Missing Online status for remote inventories
- Need a way to keep a list of those and update that over time.

Join a lobby then pick a profile to be the role as. Switch profiles later?
+ Create/Import Porfile

Password protect a profile. This is a temporary profile and does not save for autoload.

Gift box - right click to open and reveal contents. Should be the same size at the item within.

Each profile can be toggle online or offline.
- Cannot be chosen by players if offline.
- But what if changed while the player has already assumed the role?
  - Kick them out and have them restart
  - The profile select screen should be continuously updated and synced from the dm-side.
- The player view is always READ-ONLY
